# Iterative LQR / Differential Dynamic Programming
This reposit is the implementation of iterative lqr in Python. The codes are based on the works in MATLAB by Yuval, which can be found in https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52069-ilqg-ddp-trajectory-optimization. Python implementation is based on numpy library
